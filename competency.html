    <h1>Competency-Based Education</h1>
    <p>Ignis Academy students earn credit by demonstrating true mastery of a subject—no busywork, no grade inflation. Our flexible schedule allows each student to learn at their own pace and receive meaningful, personalized support.</p>

    <h2>What Makes This Different?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students only earn credit by showing they’ve mastered the material.</li>
      <li>Demonstrations are evaluated by a panel of teachers and community members.</li>
      <li>Students can progress as quickly or slowly as needed—no waiting for the term to end.</li>
    </ul>
